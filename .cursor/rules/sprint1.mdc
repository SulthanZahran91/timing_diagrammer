# Sprint 1 Task Breakdown: Foundation & Basic Canvas

## Frontend Tasks

### F1.1: Project Setup & Dependencies (4-6 hours)
**What**: Initialize React + TypeScript project with essential libraries
**Why**: Establishes the development foundation with proper tooling
**Tasks**:
- Create React app with TypeScript template
- Install D3.js, Canvas/SVG libraries, testing frameworks
- Configure ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript strict mode
- Set up folder structure (`/components`, `/hooks`, `/types`, `/utils`)
**Deliverable**: Runnable development environment

### F1.2: Core Canvas Component (8-10 hours)
**What**: Build the main drawing surface with proper coordinate system
**Why**: This is the foundation where all timing diagrams will be rendered
**Tasks**:
- Create `TimingCanvas` component with SVG or Canvas element
- Implement coordinate transformation (time → pixels, signal → Y position)
- Set up viewport management (canvas dimensions, scroll bounds)
- Add basic mouse event handling structure
**Deliverable**: Blank canvas that responds to window resizing

### F1.3: Time Grid Rendering System (6-8 hours)
**What**: Draw time scale with major/minor tick marks and labels
**Why**: Users need visual time reference to understand signal timing
**Tasks**:
- Calculate optimal tick spacing based on zoom level
- Render vertical grid lines (major = thick, minor = thin)
- Add time labels at bottom (with unit selection: ns, μs, cycles)
- Implement dynamic grid density (fewer ticks when zoomed out)
**Deliverable**: Professional-looking time grid that adapts to zoom

### F1.4: Signal Data Structure & Models (4-6 hours)
**What**: Define TypeScript interfaces for signals and timing data
**Why**: Clean data models prevent bugs and enable future features
**Tasks**:
- Create `Signal` interface (id, name, type, transitions, color)
- Define `TimingPoint` type (time, value, metadata)
- Build `SignalType` enum (clock, data, control, bus)
- Add validation functions for timing data
**Deliverable**: Type-safe data structures with examples

### F1.5: Basic Signal Rendering Engine (8-12 hours)
**What**: Render digital signals as high/low rectangles
**Why**: Core functionality - users must see their timing diagrams
**Tasks**:
- Create `SignalRenderer` component for individual signals
- Implement high/low state drawing (rectangles with transitions)
- Add signal-specific styling (colors, line thickness, patterns)
- Handle edge cases (very short pulses, overlapping transitions)
**Deliverable**: Can display 3-4 static signals with different patterns

### F1.6: Y-Axis Signal Labels (4-6 hours)
**What**: Display signal names on the left side of the canvas
**Why**: Users need to identify which signal is which
**Tasks**:
- Create fixed-position label area that doesn't scroll with time
- Align labels with signal tracks
- Handle long signal names (truncation, tooltips)
- Add basic signal type icons (clock symbol, data arrow, etc.)
**Deliverable**: Clear signal identification system

### F1.7: Basic Zoom Functionality (6-8 hours)
**What**: Mouse wheel zoom in/out centered on cursor position
**Why**: Essential for analyzing both overview and detailed timing
**Tasks**:
- Implement zoom state management (scale factor, center point)
- Add mouse wheel event handler with zoom constraints
- Update time grid and signal rendering on zoom changes
- Prevent zoom past minimum/maximum useful levels
**Deliverable**: Smooth zoom that maintains cursor focus point

## Backend Tasks

### B1.1: Node.js Server Setup (3-4 hours)
**What**: Basic Express.js server to serve the React app
**Why**: Needed for development and future API endpoints
**Tasks**:
- Initialize Node.js project with Express and TypeScript
- Set up development vs production configurations
- Configure CORS for frontend-backend communication
- Add basic error handling and logging
**Deliverable**: Running server that serves static files

### B1.2: Data Models & Validation (4-6 hours)
**What**: Server-side TypeScript interfaces matching frontend models
**Why**: Ensures data consistency between frontend and backend
**Tasks**:
- Mirror frontend `Signal` and `TimingPoint` interfaces
- Add server-side validation using Joi or Zod
- Create example timing diagram data for testing
- Add data sanitization functions
**Deliverable**: Validated data structures with test data

### B1.3: Basic API Structure (4-6 hours)
**What**: RESTful endpoints foundation for future features
**Why**: Establishes patterns for save/load and collaboration features
**Tasks**:
- Create `/api/diagrams` route structure
- Add basic CRUD endpoint skeletons (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Implement JSON request/response handling
- Add API versioning strategy (`/api/v1/`)
**Deliverable**: API endpoints that return mock data

### B1.4: File System Integration (3-4 hours)
**What**: Basic file operations for saving/loading diagrams
**Why**: Users will need to persist their work
**Tasks**:
- Set up secure file upload/download handling
- Create diagram storage directory structure
- Add file validation (size limits, format checking)
- Implement basic file naming and organization
**Deliverable**: Can save/load JSON files safely

### B1.5: Development Tooling (2-3 hours)
**What**: Scripts and tools for efficient development
**Why**: Streamlines development workflow and prevents issues
**Tasks**:
- Add hot-reload for backend changes
- Create database seeding scripts for test data
- Set up concurrent frontend/backend development
- Add basic health check endpoint
**Deliverable**: Smooth development experience

## Integration Tasks

### I1.1: Frontend-Backend Connection (4-6 hours)
**What**: Connect React app to Node.js server
**Why**: Enables data flow between client and server
**Tasks**:
- Set up Axios or Fetch for API calls
- Create React hooks for server communication
- Add loading states and error handling
- Test data flow with mock timing diagrams
**Deliverable**: Frontend displays data from backend

### I1.2: End-to-End Testing Setup (3-4 hours)
**What**: Basic testing framework for the full application
**Why**: Ensures features work together correctly
**Tasks**:
- Set up Jest for unit tests and Cypress for E2E
- Create tests for canvas rendering
- Add API endpoint testing
- Set up CI/CD pipeline basics
**Deliverable**: Automated testing that catches regressions
