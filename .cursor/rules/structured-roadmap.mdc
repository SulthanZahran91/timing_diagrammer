This is a reference for the entire project roadmap, whenever you add a feature please do a high-view check to consider this feature interaction with existing and future features in the roadmap

Sprint 1: Foundation & Basic Canvas (1-2 weeks)
Goal: Get a working canvas with time grid and basic signal display
Deliverables:

Set up React + TypeScript project with D3.js/Canvas
Render time grid with configurable scale (ns, μs, cycles)
Display static digital signals (high/low rectangles)
Basic signal labels on Y-axis
Simple zoom in/out functionality

Success Criteria: Can display 3-4 pre-defined digital signals on a time grid

Sprint 2: Signal Creation & Editing (2-3 weeks)
Goal: Users can create and modify timing diagrams
Deliverables:

Add new signals (clock, data, control types)
Click-to-toggle signal states (high/low/high-Z)
Drag signal transitions horizontally
Delete/rename signals
Basic undo/redo functionality
Save/load diagram data (JSON format)

Success Criteria: Can create a complete timing diagram for a simple digital circuit (e.g., SPI communication)

Sprint 3: Advanced Interaction & Measurements (2-3 weeks)
Goal: Professional-grade timing analysis tools
Deliverables:

Dual cursors for timing measurements
Pan with mouse drag, precision zoom
Signal grouping (buses, hierarchical view)
Time annotations and comments
Signal value annotations (hex, binary, decimal for buses)
Keyboard shortcuts for common operations

Success Criteria: Can analyze setup/hold times and measure pulse widths accurately

Sprint 4: Analysis Overlays & Validation (2-3 weeks)
Goal: Smart analysis features that add insight
Deliverables:

Setup/hold time constraint checking with visual warnings
Clock domain crossing detection
Critical path highlighting between related signals
Timing margin calculation and color-coding
Signal dependency mapping (cause → effect arrows)
Export analysis reports

Success Criteria: Can automatically detect timing violations in a complex multi-clock design

Sprint 5: Format Conversion Engine (2-3 weeks)
Goal: Transform timing diagrams into other useful formats
Deliverables:

Convert to Gantt chart (signal durations → tasks)
Generate UML sequence diagrams (signal interactions → messages)
Export to industry formats (VCD, WaveJSON)
Print-ready documentation export (PDF with annotations)
Share/collaborate features (export links, embed codes)

Success Criteria: Can generate a project timeline Gantt chart from a protocol timing diagram

Sprint 6: Polish & Advanced Features (2-3 weeks)
Goal: Production-ready application
Deliverables:

Template library (common protocols: SPI, I2C, UART, DDR)
Advanced signal types (analog, differential pairs)
Simulation mode (step through time automatically)
Performance optimization for large diagrams (1000+ signals)
User preferences and themes
Integration hooks (APIs for external tools)

Success Criteria: Can handle enterprise-scale timing diagrams with smooth performance

Optional Future Sprints:

Sprint 7: Mobile responsiveness and touch support
Sprint 8: Real-time collaboration (multiple users editing)
Sprint 9: AI-powered timing optimization suggestions
Sprint 10: Hardware simulator integration (FPGA, oscilloscope data import)
